As the pandemic progressed, more and more people with Long Covid symptoms began experiencing many of the hallmark symptoms of ME\/CFS\u2014including extreme fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM)\u2014and many eventually received formal ME\/CFS diagnoses (though, given limited understandings and resources, diagnoses often remain difficult to obtain).   <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because PEM is defined by increased and often disproportionate symptoms following potentially any physical, social, or mental activity, people with ME\/CFS often become experts at <em>pacing<\/em>, a strategy used to manage one&#8217;s energy expenditures so as not to cause a PEM &#8220;crash&#8221; or &#8220;flare.&#8221;  Unfortunately, many healthcare practitioners do not fully understand PEM, and instead encourage patients to engage Graded Exercise Therapy or other activities to &#8220;push through&#8221; their symptoms and return to &#8220;normal&#8221;\u2014tactics which reportedly worsen the symptoms of many people with ME\/CFS and Long Covid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, the activist group <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meaction.net\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.meaction.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">#MEAction<\/a> released a campaign called <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.meaction.net\/stoprestpace\/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Stop. Rest. Pace.&#8221;<\/a> to share the expertise of people with ME\/CFS with people with Long Covid, healthcare providers, and broader publics\u2014through a campaign targeting both social and mainstream media platforms.  The campaign includes videos describing these terms and phenomena, #MEAction members sharing their personal experiences, and additional resources for patients and caregivers.  It encourages people experiencing Long Covid or ME\/CFS symptoms to engage in &#8220;radical rest,&#8221; to cut activity, and monitor one&#8217;s heart rate, as well as to prioritize activities and break them into manageable chunks.  #MEAction also ran campaigns targeting news outlets, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/california\/story\/2022-07-07\/working-through-covid-sleep-rest-infection-test-positive\">Los Angeles Times<\/a>, encouraging them to include this information in their coverage of the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several people with ME\/CFS whom I interviewed for the oral history component of this project participated in creating this campaign, or have reported sharing its resources with friends and family, both to caution them against over-exertion when recovering from Covid-19 infections and to better explain their own illnesses.  \u2014Harris Kornstein<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More videos:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-3 wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-1 wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"#StopRestPace 2022\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RqFQbbx07BI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"ME\/CFS and Long COVID: What&#039;s the Connection?\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UV9NHTONrJs?start=1&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, people with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis \/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME\/CFS), an illness often triggered by a viral infection (such as Epstein Barr virus), were among the first to raise alarms about the possible implications of post-viral illness following acute infections.
