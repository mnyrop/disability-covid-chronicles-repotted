White text on black background reads: &quot;Communities of color are suffering by epic proportions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many families live in underserved areas with homes that make it harder to practice social distancing. Communities that were already lacking funds for education, health and housing are now faced with alarming infection rates and fatalities. And these communities lack access to testing and equitable healthcare.  Beyonce's BeyGOOD is supporting organizations that are on the ground 24\/7, including United Memorial Center, Bread of Life, Matthew 25 and others, to address these dire needs in some of the hardest hit areas, providing basic necessities, including food, water, cleaning supplies, medicines, face masks, and personal hygiene items. Void of these basic necessities, mental burdens are also accelerated.  To address these needs BeyGOOD teams up with with Jack Dorsey's #startsmall to donate $6 million to local community-based organizations, UCLA and the National Alliance in Mental Illness (NAMI) in providing mental wellness services in Houston, New York, New Orleans and Detroit.  These are unprecedented times and it will take our collective efforts to make a difference.&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-12214\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/BeyGOOD-Statement-Screenshot.png?resize=1024%2C723&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/BeyGOOD-Statement-Screenshot.png?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/BeyGOOD-Statement-Screenshot.png?resize=768%2C542&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/BeyGOOD-Statement-Screenshot.png?resize=1536%2C1084&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/BeyGOOD-Statement-Screenshot.png?w=1652&amp;ssl=1 1652w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/BeyGOOD-Statement-Screenshot.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a public statement from Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter&#8217;s philanthropic organization <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beyonce.com\/beygood\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BeyGOOD<\/a>, supporting Covid-19 relief for communities of color in the United States.
