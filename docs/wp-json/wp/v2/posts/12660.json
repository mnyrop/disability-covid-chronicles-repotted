With \u201cmasks optional\u201d policy in public places (including New York University!), and the Feb 1 decision of the Biden administration to officially end the COVID \u201cemergency\u201d in May 2023, the pandemic feels like \u201cthe era of fascist eugenics stretching out forever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>The authors channel the voices of disabled, black, brown, poor, trans, fat, undocumented, rural, etc. folks who have to not leave their houses for months and years in a row, for whom COVID can be deadly or lead to severe consequences, who can\u2019t afford going to the ER, access Paxlovid or healthcare, get time off work and caring responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, being safely in public with others feels like the basic survival need. As Leah puts it, \u201cbeing with other disabled people in public space is giving me the life I need right now. my mom died in December. two weeks after she passed I got in my car and drove to nyc because being in deep freeze western mass was making me lose it staring at the yellow wallpaper. I met up with Tina and our friends in the park outside their house in Chinatown, LES NYC, we were able to because they had all these hacks for being together safely outside, even when it was around freezing. me and tina and g hung out and we ran into friends spontaneously- josephine was wheeling by, al came through. we laughed, talked shit, gossiped, argued, listened to each other, asked questions. this was what i was missing- the liveness of being in public space, period and as radical disabled people, the random synchronicity of who you run into.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>As has always been the case, disabled folks can\u2019t trust governments and institutions to figure out their lives and access for them, so Leah and Tina share their own lived experiences of crip gatherings in the \u201cforever winter\u201d of COVID. The comprehensive list of resources they put together includes tips on propane heaters, camping batteries, heating pads, furs, blankets, firepits, canopies, lighting, air purifiers, etc., i.e. how to stay warm, comfy and safe while sharing the precious presence of others.<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<\/p>\n<p>The guide is written in a conversational language and is open to suggestions from anyone (write to longwintersurvival@gmail.com).<\/p>\n<p>\u2014Sasha Kurlenkova<\/p>\n<p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>this is a guide me &amp; my friend Tina wrote with ideas &amp; hacks for how disabled\/high risk people can safely hang out outside when it&#39;s cold. it&#39;s also about how as disabled people we need\/are creating ways to be together safely as the pandemic forevers. https:\/\/t.co\/UsGIyZ0zxa &mdash; Leah Lakshmi&hellip; <a class=\"continue\" href=\"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/a-long-winter-crip-survival-guide-for-pandemic-year-4-forever\/\">Continue Reading<span> A Long Winter Crip Survival Guide for Pandemic Year 4 \/ Forever<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_FSMCFIC_featured_image_caption":"","_FSMCFIC_featured_image_nocaption":"","_FSMCFIC_featured_image_hide":""},"categories":[44],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12660"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=12660"}],"version-history":[{"count":20,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12660\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12693,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12660\/revisions\/12693"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=12660"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=12660"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=12660"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
