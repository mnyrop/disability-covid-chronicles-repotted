AAPD is a collaboration between disability advocates, government agencies, and corporate and nonprofit partners to continue the work put in place by the Americans with Disabilities Act. They emphasize that &#8220;there&#8217;s more work to be done&#8221; to ensure that COVID is not forgotten in American political conversations. The release is a response to the CDC\u2019s planned edits to their COVID isolation policies, which could lower the required isolation time from 5 days to 1. The new policy says that people who are fever-free and whose symptoms improve without medical aid can return to work as soon as 24 hours after testing positive, ignoring the fact that a person&#8217;s symptoms do not reflect their ability to spread the virus. This news comes in the wake of &#8220;the United States\u2019 second-highest COVID surge since the pandemic began,&#8221; and despite the continued struggle of disabled people who are at heightened risk of COVID-19. While AAPD has been hard at work fighting for more aggressive policies to protect their constituents from the fast-spreading disease, the CDC and the US government have been stripping back countless protocols that protect disabled people. CEO &amp; President of AAPD, Maria Town, suggests a better path forward:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe solution for economic and labor market repercussions of 5-day isolation periods for COVID is for federal, state, and local governments to mandate employers provide paid sick and family leave for those who have COVID-19, or who are caring for a loved-one who has COVID-19. The answer is not to reduce isolation times and expose others to infection.&#8221;<\/p><cite>-Maria Town AAPD CEO &amp; President<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The release ends with a call to action, encouraging the disability community to call out the CDC for the potential dangers these changes could have on the at-risk people who make the community strong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Stephanie Farmer<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a February 2024 press release, the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) critiqued the Biden-Harris administration and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention for their proposed changes in isolation guidelines for people with COVID-19.
