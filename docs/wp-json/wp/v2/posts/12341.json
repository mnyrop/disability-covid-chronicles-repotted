The National Academy of Medicine estimated in a 2015 report that between 836,000 and 2.5 million Americans are affected by ME\/CFS, and an estimated 75 percent were triggered by viral or bacterial infections. Symptoms can often be so severe that patients are unable to work or perform household tasks. In May of 2017, I issued my monthly letter on ME\/CFS, whose hallmark symptoms include profound fatigue and post-exertional malaise. The diagnostic criteria for ME\/CFS can be found here. Learning more about long COVID may lead to important insights into how to treat individuals with ME\/CFS due to other viral illnesses.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While such a statement may seem small, it builds off of a campaign that resulted in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.ny.gov\/diseases\/conditions\/me-cfs\/docs\/2017-05_commissioner_letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">May 2017 letter<\/a>, and represents a significant step in gaining recognition about ME\/CFS among medical providers and political leaders.
