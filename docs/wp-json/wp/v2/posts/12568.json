Created by NYC-based artists <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/meriembennani.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Meriem Bennani<\/a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.orianbarki.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Orian Barki<\/a>, their characters and spare commentary are embodied and voiced in two animated anthropomorphized lizards as well as a number of other avatars they encounter, like the newscaster mouse. A moving and funny mirror of the new pandemic reality, we see the lizards quarantining at home, traversing the empty city, dancing on their rooftop, and watching alarming news reports, as pictured in this still from Episode 3. The series was originally released on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/meriembennani\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Bennani&#8217;s Instagram account<\/a>, and soon gained thousands of followers, and was shown as a film at the <a href=\"https:\/\/whitney.org\/exhibitions\/2-lizards\">Whitney Museum<\/a> in 2022-23. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2014Faye Ginsburg<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch episodes 1-3 below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Orian Barki and Meriem Bennani, 2 Lizards: Episode 1, 2020\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/398657270?h=94e6d35bff&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Orian Barki and Meriem Bennani, 2 Lizards: Episode 2, 2020\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/400611759?h=ceeb16c7b7&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"2 Lizards: Episode 3, 2020\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/403783175?h=97cd8a543f&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch the rest on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orianbarki.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Orian Barki&#8217;s website<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2 Lizards, the brilliant eight-part series of short animations, captures the overwhelming sense of anxiety and isolation \u2014 as well as the occasional sense of shared community \u2014 that so many NYC residents experienced during the first few months of the pandemic when the city was the epicenter of the&hellip; <a class=\"continue\" href=\"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/2-lizards-animated-series\/\">Continue Reading<span> 2 Lizards Animated Series<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":12569,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_FSMCFIC_featured_image_caption":"","_FSMCFIC_featured_image_nocaption":"","_FSMCFIC_featured_image_hide":""},"categories":[44],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/2-lizards.png?fit=3812%2C2856&ssl=1","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12568"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=12568"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12568\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":13062,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12568\/revisions\/13062"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/12569"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=12568"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=12568"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=12568"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
