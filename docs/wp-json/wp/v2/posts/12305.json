In these two short videos, Dustin Jones President &amp; Founder<br>United For Equal Access NY Inc. discusses his role as an activist, and the consequences of transportation inaccessibility on his life but also for the disability community as a whole.  \u2014Yan Grenier<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2)I also want you to meet Dustin Jones @EqualAccessNy2 President &amp; Founder United For Equal Access NY Inc.
