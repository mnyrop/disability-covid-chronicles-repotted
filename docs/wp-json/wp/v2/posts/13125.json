According to the Sick Times article,\u201cWhile COVID-19 is not the most immediate threat to life in Gaza, the disease can amplify harm from other health issues, such as injuries from Israeli airstrikes and shootings, malnutrition, and untreated chronic conditions. But media coverage of the humanitarian crisis has failed to acknowledge the ongoing pandemic and, in turn, minimizes the scope of the violence.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping COVID in the news is important to understanding the global aspects of the pandemic as the world continues to feel the impacts of the virus.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"13128\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/the-sick-times\/screenshot-2024-03-25-at-3-53-11-pm\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-3.53.11\u202fPM.png?fit=2606%2C1390&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2606,1390\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"The Sick Times home page\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-3.53.11\u202fPM.png?fit=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-3.53.11\u202fPM.png?fit=800%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"800\" height=\"427\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/disabilitycovidchronicles.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-3.53.11\u202fPM.png?resize=800%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A screenshot of The Sick Times website has the logo at the top and two columns of articles.
