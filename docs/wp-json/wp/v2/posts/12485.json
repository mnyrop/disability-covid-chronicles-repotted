Frustrated by the slowness and potential Covid exposure of in-person testing sites, Mark Riccobono, President of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) wrote to President Biden on January 3, 2022 on behalf of the thousands of NFB members to demand that the free Covid tests provided by the federal government include versions accessible to blind people.
